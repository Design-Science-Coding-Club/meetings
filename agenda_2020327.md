### The Big Idea: Communication

> "[Communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication) is the act of conveying meanings from one entity or group to another through the use of mutually understood signs, symbols, and semiotic rules."

â€” [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication)
